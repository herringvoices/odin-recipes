    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This is a dope recipe for red sauce that my wife and I use all the time. It's good for pasta, meatball subs, or even on eggs! It's one of those recipes you pull out to impress your friends.</p>
    <p>Now, I'll level with you: this recipe was stolen from Joshua Weismann's 2 Million Dollar special video on YouTube. He uses it in a chicken parm that is truly amazing. However, most of us don't have the time, energy, or inclination to deepfry on a regular basis. This sauce goes beyone that, I promise.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes </li>
        <li>1 bunch of thyme</li>
        <li>2 serano peppers</li>
        <li>4 slices of thick-cut bacon</li>
        <li>25g of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp of sugar</li>
        <li>1 TBSP of salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes to taste</li>
    </ol>
