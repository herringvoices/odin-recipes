    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This is a dope recipe for red sauce that my wife and I use all the time. It's good for pasta, meatball subs, or even on eggs! It's one of those recipes you pull out to impress your friends.</p>
    <p>Now, I'll level with you: this recipe was stolen from Joshua Weismann's 2 Million Dollar special video on YouTube. He uses it in a chicken parm that is truly amazing. However, most of us don't have the time, energy, or inclination to deepfry on a regular basis. This sauce goes beyone that, I promise.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes </li>
        <li>1 bunch of thyme</li>
        <li>2 serano peppers</li>
        <li>4 slices of thick-cut bacon</li>
        <li>25g of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp of sugar</li>
        <li>1 TBSP of salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Cut up your stuff--real small like.</li>
    <li>Cook the bacon in a sauce pan until it <em>starts</em> to get crispy</li>
    <li>Add garlic and pepper</li>
    <li>Cook until it's all <em>super</em> crispy</li>
    <li>Take it out of the pan and cut it up even smaller. Tiny, tiny bits. Then put it back in the pan.</li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes and the other stuff</li>
    <li>Cook it for about 15 minutes</li>
    <li>That's it dude. You're done. What, do you want a medal?</li>
